Use "ddm -p pae" to remove the PAE kernel from your system. Note that you cannot remove the kernel when you are currently booted into that kernel. This will select the right drivers for your Nvidia graphical card. It will select the Bumblebee drivers in case you have a hybrid card (both Nvidia and Intel). Use "ddm -p nvidia" to remove the drivers from your system. Unexpected error Use Backports You can use this command if you want to revert back to the open Nouveau drivers. It will remove any proprietary drivers from your system. You cannot remove a booted kernel.
Please, boot another kernel and try again. You have selected to install drivers from the backports repository whenever they are available.

Although you can run more up to date software using the backports repository,
you introduce a greater risk of breakage doing so.
